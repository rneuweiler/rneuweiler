- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rneuweiler
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a semiconductot engineer pursuing my PhD while working full time. I'm focusing on learning to code in python because I have a desire to learn to model chemical and material systems and apply electromagnetic theroy to them.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python using numpy, ASE, and Matplotlib; the discrete dipole approximation, Tip Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy, machine larning, and broadening my skills in semiconductor fabrication.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Love dogs, hiking, and photography
